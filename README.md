# Smart Traveling System for Individuals

## Overview
The Smart Traveling System is designed to provide efficient and real-time tracking of individual travelers' journeys. It incorporates a layered architecture, microservices, client-server communication, and distributed systems to ensure scalability, modularity, and effective real-time data exchange. This system optimizes travel experiences for users while maintaining an organized backend for processing data related to schedules, monitoring, and control.

## Architecture
The architecture of the system is designed with a combination of the following styles:

1. Layered Architecture
2. Microservices Architecture
3. Client-Server Architecture
4. Distributed Architecture

**Preferred Architecture**: Layered Architecture

## Code Structure
The system is divided into several layers as follows:

### 1. Domain Layer
The core entities representing the individual travelers, tasks, and plants are defined in this layer. The main classes are:
- **Individual**: Represents an individual worker/traveler with attributes like name, age, role, and tasks.
- **Task**: Represents a task assigned to an individual, with methods for task completion.
- **Plant**: Represents a plant or facility where workers are assigned, containing a list of workers.

### 2. Service Layer
The business logic is handled here. The `PlantService` class is responsible for:
- Assigning tasks to workers.
- Reporting progress.
- Ensuring tasks are completed.

### 3. Data Access Layer
This layer simulates persistence and handles storage operations. The `PlantRepository` class saves and retrieves plant data.

### 4. Main Class
The main class demonstrates how the different layers work together, testing the functionality by:
- Creating objects.
- Assigning tasks.
- Reporting progress.

## Diagrams
The architecture and structure of the system are further detailed in the following diagrams:

These diagrams are provided in a separate Word document for better understanding and visualization.

## Usage
To test the functionality:
1. Create `Individual` and `Plant` objects.
2. Assign tasks to workers and mark them as completed.
3. Use the `PlantService` to report progress and interact with the `PlantRepository` for data persistence.

## Conclusion
The Smart Traveling System ensures that individual travelers' tasks and journeys are managed effectively using modular and scalable architectures. It supports real-time updates, efficient task management, and optimized travel experiences.
